Reliance Business Performance Dashboard (Power BI Project)

In this project, I developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to visualize and analyze Reliance’s financial data. The report focuses on key business metrics such as revenue, profit, and returns over time, enabling data-driven decision-making for the management team.

Key highlights of the project include:
 • Revenue and Profit Analysis: Designed detailed visuals to show monthly trends in revenue generation, profit margins, and return rates, helping stakeholders monitor business health over time.
 • State-wise and Country-wise Mapping: Integrated dynamic map visualizations to represent geographical distribution of revenue and profit. Users can interactively explore performance at both the state and country levels, identifying regional strengths and weaknesses.
 • Data Modeling and Transformation: Utilized Power Query for efficient data cleaning, transformation, and normalization. Established relationships between multiple tables to create a robust data model that supports seamless analysis.
 • User Interactivity: Implemented slicers and filters for months, states, and countries, allowing users to customize their view and drill down into specific data segments.
 • Visual Design and Usability: Focused on creating a clean, intuitive layout that presents key insights at a glance, while allowing for deeper exploration through detailed charts and KPIs.

Tools Used:
 • Power BI Desktop
 • Power Query Editor
 • DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
 • Mapping visualizations (Filled Map and Shape Map)

This project demonstrates my skills in business intelligence, data analysis, and report design, and showcases my ability to turn raw data into actionable insights through visual storytelling.
